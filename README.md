## 🌟 About Me

I’m a **full-stack engineer** dedicated to building high-performance mobile and web applications. My expertise lies in the "FL" stack—**Flutter** for crafting beautiful, native-quality interfaces and **Laravel** for building secure, scalable backends. I bridge the gap between elegant design and robust logic.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- **Cross-Platform Excellence**: Building seamless iOS and Android apps with Flutter.
- **Backend Architecture**: Crafting secure RESTful APIs and microservices using Laravel.
- **State Management**: Expert implementation of Bloc, Riverpod, or Provider in Flutter.
- **Database Scalability**: Designing optimized schemas in MySQL, PostgreSQL, and MongoDB.
- **DevOps & Deployment**: Managing CI/CD pipelines and deploying to cloud environments.

## 🛠️ Core Tech Stack

- **Languages**: Dart, PHP, JavaScript (ES6+), SQL
- **Frameworks**: Flutter, Laravel, Vue.js / React
- **Mobile Development**: Firebase, App Store/Play Store Deployment, Push Notifications
- **Backend Tools**: Eloquent ORM, Laravel Sanctum/Passport, Redis, Docker
- **Testing**: PHPUnit, Flutter Integration Testing
- **Dev Tools**: Git, GitHub, VS Code, Postman, Android Studio

## ⚙️ How I Work

- **Performance First**: I optimize every query and widget to ensure a lag-free experience.
- **Clean Code**: I follow SOLID principles and PSR standards for maintainable codebases.
- **Collaboration**: I enjoy solving complex problems within a team and sharing knowledge.
